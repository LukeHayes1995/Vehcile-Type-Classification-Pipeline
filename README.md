# Vehcile-Type-Classification-Pipeline
The aim of this assignment was to create a pipeline that firstly took in a video of cars as an input. The aim was to take the video and parse it into a series of images. Then Tiny YOLO V3 was used to extract the regions of interest for potential vehicles. The vehicles in the videos could potentially be of two types, an SUV or a sedan. These regions of interest were cropped and then passed onto another classifier. This time this classifier was to classify the type of car i.e. SUV or sedan. To do so we had to take a pre-trained classifier called MobileNet which has been trained on the ImageNet weights. This classifier does image classification on up to 80 different objects and the aim here was to use a transfer learning approach to get this classifier to predict between our two classes. This meant firstly scraping images of both SUV's and sedan's from Google to create a dataset of 800 images of both. The weights of early layers in the original model were then frozen and the model was retrained and with some changes to the softmax output layer the model was ready for classification. This pipeline was then optimised using threading to speed up run-time.
